I am a Software Quality Engineer at Infosys, India, with 2+ years of experience ensuring systems are both robust and secure. My passion for cybersecurity drives me to deepen my expertise in IDPS and SIEM/SOAR platforms, as I work toward my goal of becoming a SOC analyst. Iâ€™m committed to bridging the worlds of software quality and security, and I enjoy sharing practical insights with others who are equally enthusiastic about protecting digital landscapes.
